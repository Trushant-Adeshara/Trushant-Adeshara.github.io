Unveiled the captivating wonders of physics in everyday existence to ignite a profound passion for their academic journey among incoming undergraduates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Igniting my lifelong passion for physics has been a remarkable journey, one that led me down a thrilling path of exploration into the realms of robotics and quantum computing. I was given the opportunity to share the flames of this ardor with a fresh cohort of aspiring physics undergraduates at the Babaria Institute of Technology.</p>

In a world so familiar, we often find ourselves complacently accepting the mechanics of our surroundings without a second thought. Yet, the very essence of my discourse was to awaken in these eager minds the profound marvel that physics weaves into the fabric of reality.</p>
