In May 2021, I received a message from Nikhil Venkatesh, the Director of Botsync Technologies, about an internship opportunity that I had inquired about a year earlier. I was elated to have the chance to interview with such an innovative startup.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I successfully secured the internship, but it dawned on me that this was during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and I would need to travel from my hometown to Bangalore. Fortunately, the team at Botsync Technologies was incredibly accommodating, granting me a 15-day remote work period to arrange my travel and accommodation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Starting in July 2021, I commenced my in-office work. It marked my first foray into the industry, and I quickly realized the substantial learning curve ahead. The primary programming language used was C++, and all development took place within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Thanks to my prior experience with eYantra, I was familiar with the foundational concepts of ROS, but adapting to Python for implementation was a challenging transition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I was an integral part of the core robotics software team, which provided me with firsthand exposure to the dynamics of a fast-paced startup. Remarkably, the various departments were closely interconnected, enabling me not only to advance my knowledge in software development but also gain insights into areas like fabrication, embedded systems, and assembly.</p>

During my brief tenure at Botsync, I undertook two significant tasks:

<p style="text-align: justify">
1. <b>Migration of Charging Station Code</b>: My first project involved migrating the charging station code from Python to C++, while preserving the functionality and ensuring the precise docking and undocking of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) to the charging stations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
2. <b>ROS 2-based Open-RMF Middleware</b>: Additionally, I contributed to the development of the ROS 2-based Open-RMF middleware. This middleware served as a fleet manager, facilitating the integration of heterogeneous robots through software adaptors. As part of this project, I also designed behavioral graphs for multi-robot systems, enabling the execution of collision-free tasks.</p>

Overall, my experience at Botsync was exceptionally rewarding. I'm grateful to Nikhil Venkatesh and my colleagues for their invaluable support in my professional growth during my time with the company.</p>
